# Go-Tri

This is my very first attempt at writing something in Go.

It's a simple software 3D engine that runs in a unix terminal.


    go run cmd/terrain.go


## Controls

Move around with  `w` `a` `s` `d`, up and down with `q` `e`. Click and drag the mouse to turn the camera, or use `<` `>` `z` `x`.
